# Mineseeperbot

This bot was created to get a high score on google's minesweeper but can be adapted for any other version of minesweeper. 
Using this bot I was able to get a 1 second time, (witch likely could be improved with luck) by taking advantage of the 
fact that the timer pauses when the game is minimized. 

This project was hacked together quite quickly so is not completly finished but will get the job done. The position of 
the game on the screen matters and needs to be lined up with where the program expects it too be, for my case was fully
maximized chrome window and then defualt position when you press play.

The bot itself is also not 100% able to beat the game by itself as there are some situations that it will get stuck on,
(and that are still able to be determined), but for how it was used it worked well enough.

This project was mainly practice of my python skills so there is not alot of userability in it.
